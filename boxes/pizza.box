Pizza recipe with steps | [Absolutely! Making pizza from scratch can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here’s a simple recipe along with step-by-step instructions for you:

### Ingredients:
- **For the Dough:**
  - 2 1/4 cups (290g) warm water (around 110°F or 43°C)
  - 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
  - 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  - 4 cups (500g) bread flour

- **For the Sauce:**
  - 28 ounces (800g) canned crushed tomatoes
  - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

- **Toppings:**
  - 12 ounces (340g) shredded mozzarella cheese
  - Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)
  - Any other toppings you like (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, etc.)

### Equipment:
- Large mixing bowl
- Pizza peel or baking sheet
- Rolling pin
- Baking stone (optional)
- Pizza cutter or knife

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Dough
1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and olive oil. Pour in the yeast mixture and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
3. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce
1. **Sauté the Onion and Garlic:** Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
2. **Add Tomatoes:** Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and red pepper flakes (if using). Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken slightly and the flavors should meld together.

#### Step 3: Assemble and Bake the Pizza
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C). If using a baking stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
2. **Shape the Dough:** Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions if you’re making two pizzas. Roll each portion into a circle on a floured surface, or use a rolling pin to shape it.
3. **Transfer the Dough:** If using a pizza peel, dust it with cornmeal and transfer the dough onto it. Otherwise, you can use a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. **Add Sauce and Toppings:** Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, and add any other toppings you like.
5. **Bake:** Slide the pizza onto the preheated baking stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly golden.
6. **Garnish and Serve:** Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
